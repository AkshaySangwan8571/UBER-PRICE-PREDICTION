<h2 align="center"> UBER PRICE PREDICTION </h2>
The objective of this project is to make an estimation of the cost of an Uber ride using various parameters such as distance, time of the day, weather conditions, The objective of this project is to make an estimation of the cost of an Uber ride using various parameters such as distance, time of the day, weather conditions, location, and other relevant factors. The prediction of ride prices will enable passengers to plan their trips more efficiently while assisting drivers in identifying the optimal time for driving to maximize earnings.

<h5> DATA </h5>
To conduct this project, data is sourced from Uber's API, which offers access to de-identified information related to trips. The data comprises details such as pick-up and drop-off locations, distance, fare amount, and time of the day. Besides, external data like traffic data, weather data, and other pertinent information can be utilized to enhance the precision of the forecasts.

<h5> METHODOLOGY </h5>
The aim of the project is to utilize machine learning algorithms to forecast the cost of a ride. The data will undergo preprocessing to deal with missing values, categorical data, and outliers. Exploratory data analysis will be conducted to gain insights into the data's distribution and correlations. Different metrics, including mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE), will be used to evaluate the model's performance.

<h5> TOOLS </h5>
Python programming language will be utilized to execute the project, and various libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn will be employed for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation. The project's source code will be maintained in a GitHub repository, allowing for seamless sharing, collaboration, and maintenance.

<h5> CONCLUSION </h5>
The primary objective of the project is to develop a valuable tool for both passengers and drivers to accurately estimate the cost of an Uber ride. Precise price predictions will enable passengers to make informed decisions regarding their travel plans, while drivers can maximize their earnings by selecting the optimal driving times.
